This project is a furniture e-commerce store clone built exclusively using HTML and CSS. It contains a landing page, multiple product pages, and category sections. The objective of the project was to improve my basic HTML and CSS abilities, as well as develop my understanding of project management. The project is intended to be improved in the future while I learn those tools.

All the images were generated using Bing AI. None of these images have any copyright restrictions; therefore, they could be used by anyone. The layout of the project tries to emulate a "real" e-commerce store. It has a navigation bar that provides access to all the sections: CATEGORIES: Beds, Chairs, tables, and Decoration WEBSITE SECTIONS: Home, About, and Contact.

Every category has a set of products that could be bought. These product links allow you to access the product page. Every product page contains a Product Name, Price, Description, Related Products, and a bigger image.
